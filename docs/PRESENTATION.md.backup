## Slide 2: What is MTP2?

### Core Concept

MTP2 generates **realistic arithmetic word problems** by:

1. Creating **scenarios** with agents exchanging objects
2. Building **transfer networks** using graph theory
3. Generating **diverse questions** about the scenarios
4. Adding **complexity** through masking patterns

### Example Problem

```
Story: Alex has many apples and 5 cookies.
       Sam has 10 apples.
       Alex gives 3 apples to Sam.
       In total, Alex now has 7 apples.

Question: How many apples did Alex have initially?

Answer: 10
```

**Reasoning Required**: Work backwards from final count

## Slide 8: Masking Strategies

### 3 Masking Patterns for Added Complexity

#### Pattern 1: Mask Initial Count (2.0× complexity)
```
Before: "Alex has 13 apples."
After:  "Alex has many apples."
        "In total, Alex now has 7 apples."
```
**Reasoning**: Work backwards from revealed final count

#### Pattern 2: Comparative Inference Chains (1.5× complexity)
```
Before: "Alex has 10 apples."
        "Sam has 15 apples."
        "Riley has 5 apples."

After:  "Alex has 10 apples."
        "Sam has 5 more apples than Alex."
        "Riley has 10 fewer apples than Sam."
```
**Reasoning**: Multi-step inference chain

#### Pattern 3: Percentage Ratio Masking (1.0× complexity)
```
Before: "Alex gives 10 apples to Sam."
After:  "Alex gives 50% of their apples to Sam."
```
**Reasoning**: Percentage calculation

#### Sentence Scrambling
Randomly reorder transfer sentences while preserving initial/final states
